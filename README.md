# Quantum Time Evolution with Exact Diagonalization(QuTiE-ED)

C++ code for exact time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum systems.  Allows for simulation of Hubbard models and extended hubbard models(long range interactions and long range hopping).  Allows for calculation of a variety of properties such as total energies, time dependent spectral functions, greater and lesser components of the Green's function, time dependent dipole moments

Parameter settings can be updated in the input file.  Different excitations can be implemented in the Hamiltonian.h header file in the function h_non_eq.
